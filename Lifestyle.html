            <p class="description">Millennium Park Campus is classic Chicago, with a long list of iconic things to see and do. Pay a visit to one of the city’s most famous public artworks, Cloud Gate, aka “The Bean.” Splash around in Crown Fountain, a shallow pool flanked by two 50-foot towers where the faces of Chicago locals spout water from pouting lips. Dine at McCormick Tribune Plaza’s outdoor Park Grill in the summer, or ice skate on the plaza in the winter. Hear free live music, go to summer festivals, and see films screened under the stars at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion.</p>

                      <p>The people in Chicago are some of the friendliest ‘big city’ folks we’ve come across. I used to always wonder what people meant about that Midwestern friendliness, but now I see that unlike in New York, L.A. or even Atlanta, the people in Chicago will strike up conversations with strangers, smile at you, help you out if you’re lost and give you change without too much of an attitude.<br><br> Here are a few thing that fellow Chicagoans like to do:</p>

                              <p class="description">You don’t know a thing about baseball – so what? Head to Wrigleyville during the Spring or Summer months and pick up a pair of tickets to a baseball game. Get a funny hat, drink a few beers and take part in the grand Chicago tradition that stems back to the early 1900s. Make a whole night of it and get there early enough to watch fans, touts and TV crews arriving in en masse and stake out a couple of bar stools at one of the local bars both before and after the game to take part in some crazy drunken festivities. There is nothing like a Cubs game in the summer in Chicago.</p>

                                  <p class="description">From the far northern neighborhoods of Chicago all the way through downtown, the Lake Shore cycling path allows cyclists to sail through 10-15 miles(16 - 24 kms) right along the shores of Lake Michigan. This is great for a work-out, and you’ll no doubt share a lot of the space with the hundreds of joggers and walkers out there, but this also keeps you out of Chicago traffic as well. Chicago is a great cycling city in general and with the Divvy Bikes bikesharing program, cycling was made an integral part of transportation in Chicago when they launched the program in 2013.</p>

The crust is usually two to three inches(2.54cm) tall and gets slightly fried due to the oil in the pan</p>
